# Verilog Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of my *Verilog HDL projects*, built as part of my continuous learning and digital design development.  
These projects explore everything from logic fundamentals to complete FPGA-based systems.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 📟 1. 24-Hour Digital Clock Design
*Description*:  
A mini project implemented using Verilog that displays real-time in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS) on a 4-digit 7-segment display using multiplexing logic.

*Features*:
- Displays hours and minutes (seconds maintained internally for time accuracy)
- Uses 1 Hz clock for time counting
- Digit multiplexing using a counter and refresh technique
- Asynchronous reset
- Target FPGA: *Artix-7 (Invent Logics Edge Board)*

*Modules Included*:
- Clock Divider (50 MHz ➝ 1 Hz & 500 Hz)
- BCD Time Counter (HH:MM with internal seconds)
- 7-Segment Display Encoder
- Multiplexed Display Driver Logic

### 🚦 2. Traffic Light Controller using FSM with 7-Segment Countdown Display
*Description*:  
A state-machine-based traffic light controller that manages Red, Yellow, and Green signals with integrated countdown displayed on a 7-segment display.

*Features*:
- Implements FSM with defined timing for each light
- Countdown timer displayed on 7-segment
- Synchronous timing and reset logic
- Easily scalable to support pedestrian mode or extended phases

*Modules Included*:
- FSM Controller with timing logic
- Countdown timer using registers
- 7-Segment Display Encoder
- Target FPGA: *Artix-7*
